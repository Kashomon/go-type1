# Gooe Type1

Type1 Font versions of the Gooe fonts

This work derives from [Vit Brunner (tasuki)](https://github.com/tasuk)
who created a series of tsumego
books. This repository gives more instruction how to install these Type1 fonts
and how to use them.

### In

In `fonts/`, we have the base .afm, .pfa, pfb, and .tfm files.  This represents
a large amount of the work. However, we still have to create the latex support
files.
